# Android-Application-Track

Android application testing is a crucial part of mobile security that helps identify and fix vulnerabilities that attackers can exploit. It involves both manual and automated techniques to evaluate an app's security posture across multiple layers.

## Android Application Testing Parts

#### this can be devided into two based on the process
##### Static Analysis
Static analysis of an Android app involves examining the APK file without running the app. This helps identify security flaws such as hardcoded credentials, insecure permissions, exposed components, and API keys. It’s a fast way to detect vulnerabilities early and secure the app from potential cyber attacks.

##### Dynamic Analysis
Dynamic analysis involves testing the app while it’s running on a device or emulator. It helps identify real-time vulnerabilities like insecure data transmission, authentication flaws, runtime injections, and logic bypasses.
